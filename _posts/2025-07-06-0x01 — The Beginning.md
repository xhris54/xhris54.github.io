Hey! I'm Krishna, a curious mind in the world of **cybersecurity and bug hunting**. This blog is my little corner on the web — a place where I’ll share stories, technical breakdowns, PoCs, and raw learnings from my journey.


##  Where I Started


Like many, I didn’t begin with a CS degree. I come from a **commerce background**, but I’ve always had a passion for **technology, hacking, and understanding how things break**. That passion led me into the world of:

- Web application security
- Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges
- Real-world bug bounties
- Writing my own vulnerable labs to learn deeper

---

##  What You'll Find Here

This blog will be a mix of:

- Writeups on real vulns (XSS, IDORs, path traversal ,BAC, etc.)
- Notes from red teaming and lab setups
- Mistakes I made and lessons I learned
- Lightweight tutorials for beginners getting into bug bounty
- Research logs and my exploration into deeper system-level security

##  Why "XHRIS54"?

Well, “XHR” stands for XMLHttpRequest — a nod to how I got into bug hunting: by opening dev tools and watching network requests like a detective. And “54” is just my hacker ID that stuck.

##  Let’s Connect

This is more than a blog — it's a logbook of growth. If you’re new to hacking, or switching fields like me, I hope my posts help you feel less alone. If you're experienced, maybe you'll still find something useful (or correct me when I go wrong).

Thanks for visiting.  
Let’s explore the web’s cracks — one request at a time.
